summary: Making my own CHIP-8 emulator! A great way to learn the basics of how a CPU works.
---

I was first introduced to C in a programming class for electrical engineering students. I enjoyed the "low-level" nature of the language and wanted to work on
a project to learn more about it. After some searching, I decided that making a CHIP-8 emulator might be a nice way to do so, while also learning about the basics
of a CPU.

## What is a CHIP-8 emulator?

What is an emulator in the first place? An emulator is essentially software (sometimes hardware) that enables a computer to behave like a different computer. In the context of
video games, an emulator allows you to play video games that were designed for other devices. For example, a gameboy emulator allows you to play games that were written
for the gameboy directly on your PC.

From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">Wikipedia</a>, CHIP-8 is an "interpreted programming language that runs on a virtual machine".
Interpreted languages do not need to be converted into machine code for them to run, as opposed to compiled languages. Making a CHIP-8 emulator is really just
making a CHIP-8 interpreter since there is no actual underlying hardware. When making a CHIP-8 interpreter, we are essentially defining how to process inputs and outputs,
display graphics, run audio, and more all inside of the virtual machine.

## CHIP-8 System Description

The CHIP-8 wiki page goes over the memory, registers, and opcodes for the system pretty well.

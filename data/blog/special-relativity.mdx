summary: A small introduction to special relativity.

In 1905, in what has been referred to his miracle year, Einstein published (among others) two papers on special relativity. The first paper introduced special
relativity while the second detailed its consequences. Special relativity describes the link between time and space for objects moving at a constant speed.

There are two principles or postulates that form the basis of special relativity: the relativity principle and the constancy of the speed of light. The relativity
principle states that the laws of physics are the same regardless of the frame of reference. The second principle states that light propagates through space with
a defined speed $c$ that is the same for all observers.

### Time Dilation

Einstein predicted that time passes differently in one reference frame compared to another. Imagine you're in a very fast spaceship and you shine a light off of a mirror.

The time it takes for the light to return is given by:

$$t_{0}=\frac{2D}{c}$$

Now, let's say that you're standing on the ground and witness someone in a passing spaceship shining a light off of a mirror.

The above figure represents the spaceship as it is passing the stationary observer. During the time it takes for the light to return, the spaceship travels
a distance of $2L$ so $2L=vt$ -> $L=\frac{vt}{2}$. The total distance the light travels is equal to $2\sqrt{D^{2}+L^{2}}$

The time it takes for the light to return, relative to the observer is:

$$t=\frac{2\sqrt{D^{2}+L^{2}}}{c}$$

Substituting our expression for $L$ we have:

$$t=\frac{2\sqrt{D^{2}+\frac{v^{2}t^{2}}{4}}}{c}$$

which can be rearranged into:

$$t=\frac{2D}{\sqrt({c}^2-{v}^2)}$$

$$t=\frac{2D}{c\sqrt(1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2})}$$

We can substitute $D$ using our initial expression for $t_{0}$.

$$t=\frac{t_{0}}{\sqrt(1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2})}$$

We have two expressions for two different times $t$ and $t_{0}$. The time measured on the spaceship is given by $t_{0}$ while the time measured by the stationary
observer is $t$. According to the above expression, the time $t$ is always greater than $t_{0}$. In other words, the time that passes by for the stationary observer
is always greater than the time that passes by for the moving observer. Time is measured to move more slowly in any moving reference. Time dilation shows that
the faster an observer moves through space, the slower they move through time.

### Length Contraction

Lengths and distances also differ depending on the frame of reference. Let's say you're on a spaceship travelling from Earth to Mars. The time it takes to travel
from Earth to Mars is given by:

$$t=\frac{L_{0}}{c}$$

For an observer on Earth, we see the spaceship moving away from Earth and toward Mars. For the observer on the spaceship, they see themselves as being stationary
while the Earth moves away from them and Mars moves towards them. The time between the departure of Earth and arrival on Mars is less for the observer on the
spaceship due to time dilation. The time it takes for them is given by:

$$t_{0}=t\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}$$

Since the spaceship observer measures the same speed but less time, they must also measure a smaller distance. If $L$ is the distance between planets relative
to the spaceship, then $L=vt_{0}$. We can rewrite the above time expression as:

$$\frac{L}{v}=\frac{L_{0}}{v}\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}$$

$$L=L_{0}\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}$$

The length of an object is measured to be shorter when it is moving than when it is at rest.

### Mass Increase

Mass of an object increases as its speed increases according to:

$$m_{0}=\frac{m}{\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}}$$

As an object is accelerated to greater speeds, its mass becomes larger. If $v$ was equal to $c$, then the denominator becomes 0 and mass becomes infinite.
If $v$ is greater to $c$ then the value inside the square root is negative, therefore $c$ is the speed limit.

### Mass and Energy

The net work done on a particle is equal to its change in kinetic energy, but at high speeds $E=\frac{1}{2}m{v}^2$ is not entirely correct. Kinetic energy
of a high speed particle is equal to $E=m_{0}{c}^2-m{c}^2$ where $m{c}^2$ is rest energy. When the energy of a system changes by $\Delta{E}$, the mass changes by
$\Delta{m}$. Therefore, we have $\Delta{E}=\Delta{m}{c}^2$. Einstein's most famous equation!
